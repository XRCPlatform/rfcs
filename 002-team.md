# Teams and Governance

 * Authors: @baff5b
 * Start: 31 Jan. 2021
 * Status: PROPOSAL 
 
# Summary 

 * Define community principles for participation
 * Describe all projects that need resources

# Motivation

The xRhodium and FM.one development team is composed of seven members take on various aspects of xRhodium and FM.one development:

 * xRhodium Node development
 * Wallet development
 * Marketing 
 * FM.one development
 * StrongHands asset management and distribution
 * Strategy
 * Server resource management (maintaining a minimum network, other ancillary resources)
 * xRhodium Ambassador Program
 * Dev and marketing fund management
 * Exchange relationship managment and exploration
 
 With this in mind and an interest in building out new projects, it would be good to involve and engage the xRhodium community more knowing that there needs to be some plan on we would proceed.
 
## Objectives

 * Recognize opportunities for contribution: Drive conversation on ideas and do what is necessary to make progress on those ideas. 
 * Open communication: Discuss ideas, plans and progress with the community to develop engagement with our projects.
 * Make the xRhodium team and management less centralized: Rely less on a few people but scale to more people who want xRhodium to be a success. 

## Not Objectives

 * Avoid "force of personality" to maintain the project: everyone leads, but no one is "CEO"
 * Little bureaucracy: Whatever needs to get done. When we need to take notes, have light systems to do this for communication
 * Not discourage contributions: If the idea is good, it should be done and no one should wait for the development team to implement it.
 
 
# Explanation

The xRhodium Development Team is not a company but a group of individuals who have a vested interest in seeing xRhodium and FreeMarket.one succeed. Our project and goal is to create an open currency and marketplace that is free of restriction and of any form centralization and to encourage the wider community to join in our story. The development team feels that scaling our team not in a dynamic way can help introduce more innovation and progress on the things we want to do to draw more interest to our projects.

The goal of this document to describe a very light first attempt at defining what we need to start scaling our projects with the ability to open ourselves to revision.

This is inspired by the first Grin governance model: https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-grin-governance.md. However, it is not intended to take every aspect or consideration it mentions.

## Priniciples

* Constructive contributions is the only source of truth in our projects. Ideas are a dime-a-dozen, implementations are golden.
* Consensus-seeking is better than voting: better ideas came from discussion within our project when everyone is comfortable with ideas.
* Simplicity and clarity is more important than ambition: The things that went right with us are simple to develop and simple to maintain.
* We are individuals, not a company: while we deal with a valuable product, that is not the only story, but part of a bigger goal.
* Groups should form around good projects - xRhodium is not intended to be a centralized project. _Potential contributors do not have to wait for approval from the core team to start on good ideas._


## Core team

The xRhodium development team, as of this writing, must continue to manage all aspects of the project in whatever capacity it can. There are a number of large projects to maintain, but the current team wants to develop a focus, with each member focusing on their skills for the separate projects involved.

The core team:

 * Sets an overall vision for the project
 * As individuals, try to seek out others to develop their part of the project
 * As a team, work together where it makes sense to set priorities
 * Manage tangible resources (StrongHand coins, funds, minimal network resources, domain names, signing certificates) as needed
 * Own all releases of all products and to manage all official source code repositories to ensure software releases are delivered by trusted people only.

## Teams

Each subproject should self-organize, doing what is necessary to advance the project. For the core team, we only ask of teams to consider the value created in the xRhodium/FreeMarket.one name and reputation when advancing their product. Contributors can overlap between different teams and as of this writing, is absolutely necessary.

### Recommended teams to spin-off

 * Node development: Maintaining and advancing core coin development: consensus, coin implementation, research. (Current projects: BRhodiumNode)
 * Wallet development: Maintain wallet UIs and APIs, including node wallet. (Current projects: Web Wallet, ElectrumRhodium, HW wallet integrations)
 * Marketing: Tell the world about xRhodium, talk to investors (Current projects: Ambassador Program)
 * Community development: Onboard new community members and support Discord, Telegram, events, meetups.
